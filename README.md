## Contributing

I will set up a contribution guide when I can. In the meantime, feel free to provide feedback any way you see fit. This project is still fairly new, after all.

Big thanks to [king1600](https://github.com/king1600) for helping me to better understand lexical analysis and precedence climbing, and providing me the resources I needed to carry out this project.
